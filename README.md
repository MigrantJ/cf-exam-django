This app was created for the CodeFellows Python Coding Challenge.

It uses Django 1.7 to allow management of user information, contained in a NoSQL database.

Some additional features beyond what was required for the challenge:

+ Bootstrap was used to give the app a nice coat of paint. I wanted to learn how to use Bootstrap, and this seemed like an ideal project.
+ A biography field was added to the User model. A shortened version of this bio is automatically delivered by Django for the index page.
+ A confirmation popup is given when attempting to delete a user.
